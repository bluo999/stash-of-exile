# Stash of Exile

Stash of Exile is a stash and character searcher for Path of Exile developed in Python with PyQt6. It is still early in development, so there are no releases yet.

Stash of Exile is finally in a usable state, so importing an entire account's worth of items will work, thought may be slow at the moment.
